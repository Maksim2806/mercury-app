1. Created Create-React-App
2. Configured ESLint and environment
3. Prepared a request service
4. Then began to create components and write logic
5. In the end, through the service that I wrote about above, I connected the backend

Of course, there were difficulties in creating the application, but everything can be solved, it all depends on the time.

The main difficulty is the time limit.

I tried to make a working application as soon as possible, omitting the pixel perfect. if I had more time, I would do everything better.

Unfortunately, I didn't have time with the layout, because I focused on writing logic.

Summing up, I want to say that the task seemed very interesting to me. It covers the main aspects of the web developer profession. Regardless of your decision, thanks for the experience provided, I do not intend to dwell on this, I will develop further, because it is very exciting and interesting.
